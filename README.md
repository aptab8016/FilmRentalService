# FilmRentalService
Built an entire movie rental website from the ground up. Took care of the backend stuff using Spring Boot and made the frontend with Angular. Made it super easy for users to find and rent movies at a low cost. This project demonstrates my ability to make things both look good and work smoothly. Users can rent films for a few days through this app.
